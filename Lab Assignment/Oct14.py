# Lab Questions

# Q1. Imagine you are arranging students in a line according to their height.You keep comparing two students standing next  to each other — if the shorter one is behind, you swap their position. You keep doing this again and again until everyone is standing in order from shortest to tallest.
    # Example: students_height = [160, 150, 170, 155, 165]
# Q2. Imagine you are holding playing cards in your hand. You pick one card at a time from the deck and insert it into the correct position in your already sorted hand.
    # Example: cards = [7, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 1]
# Q3. Think of choosing the cheapest item from a store’s price list each time. You first pick the item with the lowest price, remove it, then pick the next lowest, and keep going until all are sorted.
    # Example: prices = [250, 100, 200, 50, 150]
